### **This package is no longer maintened, you can switch to [node-red-contrib-simple-webdriver](https://github.com/simonradier/node-red-contrib-simple-webdriver) which provides the same set of feature but not based on selenium to avoid the dependency with Java.**

# node-red-contrib-selenium-wd2

Selenium-wd2 nodes for Node-Red allow web browser automation based on the [Selenium-Webdriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/) API. Based on [node-red-constrib-selenium-webdriver](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-selenium-webdriver) library, it was rewritten in Typescript to ease its maintenance, improve the overall stability and upgrade a little bit the set of features.

## Prerequisite

In order to use node-red-contrib-selenium-wd2, you must fullfill the following prerequisite :

- Install java 8 or later
- Install a selenium server : `npm install -g webdriver-manager`
- Install a node-red server : `npm install -g --unsafe-perm node-red`

## Installation

- Install node-red-contrib-selenium-wd2 library : `npm install -g node-red-contrib-selenium-wd2` and that's all!

## Run

Launch Node-red `node-red` and the selenium-wd2 will be loaded automatically. You should see the list of node under the wd2 section.

## Develop

If you want to contribute, you can install clone the project and run the following command :

- `npm run clean && npm run prepublishOnly` (linux only)

To test it, you will have to :

- Install a node-red locally (in another folder) `npm install -g node-red`
- Launch, from the `node-red` folder, the following command to debug :

  `npm install [PATH_TO_SELENIUM_WD2] && node --inspect node_modules/node-red/red.js`

## Behavior

You will always have to start with an
Some nodes will provide two outputs a success and a failure one.

- Success output is used if the node execution is successful and if the flow execution can continue (i.e. the driver is still ok)
- Failure ouput is used in case of "soft" error (an element can't be found or an expected value is not correct). It aims to support dysfonctional use cases. (If something can't be clicked or found)
- Error is launched in case of "critical" error (i.e. the driver can't be used anymore). It means you will have to handle yourselft the cleaning on the selenium-driver side in this case.

## Documentation

All nodes provides their own documentation directly inside node-red.
